    </p>

    <p>Product Support:  AMPLIFY </p>

    <p>

        We are committed to helping campaigns/organizations fully utilize the AMPLIFY, and to provide support that will help your organization to successfully use the software. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
        We have a full-time technical support staff dedicated to helping clients with AMPLIFY. We triage requests that come into the support staff and will help you as quickly as possible, dependent on current work load.         
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of Amplify is to give organizations and campaigns cutting edge tools to manage membership, residents, and voters in efforts to support their mission.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Because of this, the most successful AMPLIFY users have basic computer and Internet skills, and general knowledge of the campaign process and terminology. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We often receive requests that are covered in the AMPLIFY documentation. Answers to questions such as how to navigate various modules or activities can be found in the documentation.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        IE United strives to provide more IE United resources and additional staff during peak times for campaigns, but cannot guarantee such resource allocation.     
    </p>

    <p>
            What’s Covered in your Free Support Package

    </p>

    <p>     
        With AMPLIFY, you have access to free product support options that address a problem or defect related to the normal operation and functioning of the program. Additional support options are available for a fee. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The support team will: 
    </p>

    <p>
        - Prioritize errors within the program above all else. If you are getting an error screen, a time out, or the program is behaving incorrectly, please contact IEU Support as soon as possible.      
    </p>

    <p>
        - Provide a one-time orientation to your campaign or organization. This is one 45-minute orientation by web conference for as many people in your organization as you would like. The orientation will cover basics about how to use the program. Please allow 3 to 4 business days for scheduling the orientation. 

    </p>

    <p>
            - Provide limited phone and email technical support during normal business hours. This service is always free if questions reflect problems with the normal operating and functioning of the program or subjects not covered in product documentation. Users will be notified if a call does not qualify as free support. - Point you to the support documentation if the answer can be found there. 

    </p>

    <p>
        - Respond to urgent and emergency requests. If you find yourself stuck and it is a true emergency, we recommend that you alert support and your IE United representative, notifying them of the nature of the emergency and what your timing is regarding a solution—we handle requests better when we know, “I have a walk Saturday morning at 9” rather than “I need this solved ASAP.” 
    </p>

    <p>
            The support team cannot: 

        
    </p>
    <p>
            - Provide strategic guidance about who you should be targeting or how to target your voters. These decisions are up to you and your team. 


    </p>

    <p>
            - Give out passwords over the phone. If you have password issues, please contact support@ieunited.org. 

    </p>

    <p>
            - Help with non-IEU related tech issues. 

        
    </p>
    <p>
            Availability & Response Time 


    </p>
    
    <p>
            When you contact IEU support, you can expect to receive an initial response within a timely manner. If the issue is something that requires something more than a simple answer, we may need more time to investigate and process the issue, and then will contact you when the issue is resolved. You will receive the quickest response by sending a detailed email to Support@ieunited.org during business hours. 

        

    </p>

    <p>
            All year round: You can expect an initial response to your call or email within about an hour during normal business hours: 10am to 5pm, Monday through Thursday. 

    </p>

    <p>
            Within three months of your election: We’ll monitor phone and emails after hours and on weekends. Between 5pm and 8pm, and from 9am to 5pm on weekends, you can expect an initial response to your call or email within 4 hours. 


    </p>

    <p>
            Within one month of your election: We’ll respond to emails and calls within about an hour from 9am to 8pm every day. 


    </p>

    <p>
        If you are running a special election campaign, support hours may not adhere to these hours. Please discuss support expectations with your IEU representative. During peak times, we prioritize clients with earlier election dates ahead of those with longer lead times. For example: During the final month of a statewide primary or general election, we may ask clients preparing for later elections to postpone training appointments and non-urgent requests so that we're able to focus on other clients' more immediate needs. Of course, this means we'll give you the same consideration as your own election dates grows near. Due to the cyclical nature of campaigns, our support team is in highest demand during the same time that campaigns are working the most. For instance, our busiest time during campaign season is on Friday afternoons and evenings when organizations are prepping walk sheets, phone sheets, and preparing for weekend grassroots efforts. Please keep this in mind when you are getting started in the program and allow extra time in the beginning to get used to the program—it’s better to need a question answered a couple days before your volunteer walk than a couple of hours before, causing stress on both ends.
    </p>
    <p>
        How to Reach Us

    </p>

    <p>
            Our small, but dedicated, support team works on an on-call basis. This means that you may not get the same support person each time, but that we are all usually briefed and aware of support issues. 
    </p>

    <p>
            You will receive the fastest response by joining our discord server at https://discord.gg/Dsn3zrv. Inside the server you will find resource and support channels. Staff is monitoring the discord server 24/7. If you are having trouble accessing discord or are not getting a response, you can also email support@ieunited.org. 

    </p>

    <p>
            When troubleshooting an issue, it always helps to know as much of the following as possible: - What is your organization – What campaign where you working on – What module where you working in - When did the issue start happening? - When is your deliverable due? - What device are you working on? (IOS, Android, Windows, MAC...etc).
